                <h2>The game</h2>
                <p>Hollow Knight is a challenging 2D action-adventure. You’ll explore twisting caverns, battle tainted
                    creatures and escape intricate traps, all to solve an ancient long-hidden mystery.</p>
                <p>Beneath the fading town of Dirtmouth sleeps a vast, ancient kingdom. Many are drawn beneath the
                    surface, searching for riches, or glory, or answers to old secrets.

                    As the enigmatic Knight, you’ll traverse the depths, unravel its mysteries and conquer its evils.

                <h2>The art</h2>
                <p>Hollow Knight has one of the most impressive art efforts I've ever seen in a videogame. The hand-drawn animation gives the player a sense of smoothness while playing the game, and it's hard to not stop for a moment to look at the scenario. In every new area you'll be cativated by the 2D style NPCs.</p>
                <p>The music is also a great part of what makes the game great. The composer Christopher Larking did an amazing job with the few resourced that he had. Each area of the game has a different soundtrack the perfectly fits the environement. Not just that, but each boss has it's own original soundtrack, making the fights astonishing</p>
