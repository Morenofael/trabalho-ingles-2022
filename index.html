                <h2>The game</h2>
                <p>Hollow Knight is a challenging 2D action-adventure. You’ll explore twisting caverns, battle tainted
                    creatures and escape intricate traps, all to solve an ancient long-hidden mystery.</p>
                <p>Beneath the fading town of Dirtmouth sleeps a vast, ancient kingdom. Many are drawn beneath the
                    surface, searching for riches, or glory, or answers to old secrets.

                    As the enigmatic Knight, you’ll traverse the depths, unravel its mysteries and conquer its evils.

                <h2>The art</h2>
                <p>Hollow Knight has one of the most impressive art efforts I've ever seen in a videogame. The hand-drawn animation gives the player a sense of smoothness while playing the game, and it's hard to not stop for a moment to look at the scenario. In every new area you'll be cativated by the 2D style NPCs.</p>
                <p>The music is also a great part of what makes the game great. The composer Christopher Larking did an amazing job with the few resourced that he had. Each area of the game has a different soundtrack the perfectly fits the environement. Not just that, but each boss has it's own original soundtrack, making the fights astonishing.</p>

                <h2>The gameplay and the story</h2>
                <p>You begin the game as a fragile looking bug in a wasteland. You have no idea of what you are, or why you are there. That's because the game has a great way of telling you the story: it doesn't expose the narrative right in front of you. It feels like the story already happened, and you have so find out what happened by yourself. As you try to make your way into each objective, it's very easy to get lost in the map. And that's very good, since that's what the game intended. You get lost, find new places, discouver new pieces of the story, and find yourself again. The game is a metroidvania, wich means you don't have to follow a linear order to play it. When you get a new ability, you unlock multiple paths, not just one.</p>
                <p>The fights are also incredibly well planned. Each boss has a completely different set of atacks, forcing you to adapt to them. Getting one step through in the game doesn't make you feel stronger, but smarter.</p>
